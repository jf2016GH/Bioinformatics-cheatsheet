- **DNA-seq**: DNA sequencing is the process of determining the precise order of nucleotides within a DNA molecule. [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing)
- **RNA-seq**: RNA-seq (RNA sequencing), also called whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing[1] (WTSS), uses next-generation sequencing (NGS) to reveal the presence and quantity of RNA in a biological sample at a given moment in time. [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq)
- **CLIP-Seq**: [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLIP)
- **FAIRE-seq**: [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIRE-Seq)
- **DNase-Seq**: [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNase-Seq)
- **CAGE**: [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_analysis_gene_expression)
- **ChIA-PET**: [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chia_Pet)
- **5C/Hi-C**: [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_conformation_capture) 
- **Promoter Capture Hi-C**: Promoter capture Hi-C (PCHi-C) allows the genome-wide interrogation of physical interactions between distal DNA regulatory elements and gene promoters in multiple tissue contexts.
