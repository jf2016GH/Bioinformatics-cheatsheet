## DNA Methylation Detection Methods
- **MeDIP/mDIP - Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation**: Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP or mDIP) is a large-scale (chromosome- or genome-wide) purification technique in molecular biology that is used to enrich for methylated DNA sequences. [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylated_DNA_immunoprecipitation)
- **MeDIP-seq**: The MeDIP-seq approach, i.e. the coupling of MeDIP with next generation, short-read sequencing technologies such as 454, Illumina (company) (Solexa), was first described by [Down et al. in 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2644410). The high-throughput sequencing of the methylated DNA fragments produces a large number of short reads (36-50bp or 400 bp depending on the technology).
