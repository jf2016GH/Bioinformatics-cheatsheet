# Contributing
Contributions are always so very welcome!

## Guidelines
- Fork the project.
- Make directories under ./docs for new parts.
- Add `<!-- toc -->` for a new section under `h1` so table of contents can be generated automatically.
- Search previous items before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Add your items: 
```
	- **item-name**: A short description ends with a dot. [@Wiki](http://wikiexample.com)
	- **[item-name](http://example.com/)**: A short description ends with a dot.
```
