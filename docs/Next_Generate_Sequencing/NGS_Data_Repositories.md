- **[1000 Genomes Project](http://www.1000genomes.org/)**: The 1000 Genomes Project ran between 2008 and 2015, creating the largest public catalogue of human variation and genotype data.
- **[Array Express](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/)**: an NIH-funded database at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory -European Bioinformatics Institute that collects and disseminates microarray-based gene-expression data.
- **[DDBJ](http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/)**: DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) is a data bank organized by the National Institute of Genetics in Japan that collects sequence data.
- **[ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/)**: The goal of ENCODE is to build a comprehensive parts list of functional elements in the human genome, including elements that act at the protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements that control cells and circumstances in which a gene is active.
- **[GEO](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)**: GEO is a public functional genomics data repository supporting MIAME-compliant data submissions. Array- and sequence-based data are accepted.
- **[GermOnline](http://www.germonline.org/index.html)**: The GermOnline 4.0 gateway is a cross-species microarray expression database focusing on germline development, meiosis and gametogenesis as well as the mitotic cell cycle.
- **[Roadmap Epigenomics Project](http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/)**: The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium was launched with the goal of producing a public resource of human epigenomic data to catalyze basic biology and disease-oriented research.
- **[Expression Atlas](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa)**: The Expression Atlas provides information on gene expression patterns under different biological conditions such as a gene knock out, a plant treated with a compound, or in a particular organism part or cell. [@Ref](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/D1/D746.full)
- **[ExAC](http://exac.broadinstitute.org/)**: The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) is a coalition of investigators seeking to aggregate and harmonize exome sequencing data from a wide variety of large-scale sequencing projects, and to make summary data available for the wider scientific community.
- **[WTCCC](https://www.wtccc.org.uk/)**: The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) was established with an aim to harness the power of newly-available genotyping technologies to improve our understanding of the aetiological basis of several major causes of global disease.
- **[CommonMind Consortium](https://www.synapse.org//#!Synapse:syn2759792/wiki/69613)**: The CMC is generating data across multiple regions from >1000 postmortem brain samples from donors with Schizophrenia, Bipolar disease and individuals with no neuropsychiatric disorders - originating from tissue collections at four brain banks. Data consists of DNA and RNA sequencing, genotyping and epigenetics. 
- **[TOPMed](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/resources/nhlbi-precision-medicine-initiative/topmed)**: The NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program will support the Instituteâ€™s larger precision medicine activities by collecting and coupling whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and other -omics data (e.g., DNA methylation signature, RNA expression profiles, metabolite profiles) with molecular, behavioral, imaging, environmental, and clinical data from studies focused on heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS) disorders.
