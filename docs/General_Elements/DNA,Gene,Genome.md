## Related Terms
- **DNA**: Deoxyribonucleic acid is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA), [@NIH](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/dna)
- **Gene**: A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA which is made up of nucleotides and is the molecular unit of heredity. [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene), [@NIH](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene)
- **Promoter**: In genetics, a promoter is a region of DNA that initiates transcription of a particular gene. Promoters are located near the transcription start sites of genes, on the same strand and upstream on the DNA (towards the 5' region of the sense strand). [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(genetics))
- **TSS - Transcription Start Side**: The transcription start site is the location where transcription starts at the 5'-end of a gene sequence. [@Wiki](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Gene_transcriptions/Start_sites)
- **Expression (Gene expression)**: Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product. These products are often proteins, but in non-protein coding genes such as transfer RNA (tRNA) or small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, the product is a functional RNA. [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression), [@Scitable](http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/gene-expression-14121669)
- **Exon**: An exon is any part of a gene that will become a part of the final mature RNA produced by that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing. [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exon)
- **Intron**: An intron is any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is removed by RNA splicing during maturation of the final RNA product. [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intron)
