<!-- toc -->

- **[AHD2.0](http://ahd.cbi.pku.edu.cn)**: The aim of the Arabidopsis hormone database is to provide a systematic and comprehensive view of morphological phenotypes regulated by plant hormones, as well as regulatory genes participating in numerous plant hormone responses.
- **[DrugBank](http://www.drugbank.ca/)**: The DrugBank database is a unique bioinformatics and cheminformatics resource that combines detailed drug (i.e. chemical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical) data with comprehensive drug target (i.e. sequence, structure, and pathway) information.
- **[TTD - Therapeutic Target Database](http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/BIDD-Databases/TTD/TTD.asp)**: A database to provide information about the known and explored therapeutic protein and nucleic acid targets, the targeted disease, pathway information and the corresponding drugs directed at each of these targets.
- **[STITCH](http://stitch.embl.de/)**: STITCH is a resource to explore known and predicted interactions of chemicals and proteins.
