Methods\r\n- **[CoIP - Co-immunoprecipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-immunoprecipitation)**: is considered to be the gold standard assay for protein–protein interactions, especially when it is performed with endogenous (not overexpressed and not [tagged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitope#Epitope_tags)) proteins. The protein of interest is isolated with a specific antibody. Interaction partners which stick to this protein are subsequently identified by [Western blotting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_blotting). Interactions detected by this approach are considered to be real. \r\n- **[Bimolecular fluorescence complementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimolecular_fluorescence_complementation)**: (BiFC) is a new technique in observing the interactions of proteins. Combining with other new techniques, this method can be used to screen protein–protein interactions and their modulators, [DERB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DERB).\r\n- **[Affinity electrophoresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_electrophoresis)**: as used for estimation of [binding constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/binding_constant)s, as for instance in [lectin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lectin) affinity electrophoresis or characterization of molecules with specific features like [glycan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glycan) content or [ligand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ligand) binding.\r\n- **Pull-down assays**: are a common variation of [immunoprecipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immunoprecipitation) and [immunoelectrophoresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immunoelectrophoresis) and are used identically, although this approach is more amenable to an initial screen for interacting proteins.\r\n- **[Label transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Label_transfer)**: can be used for screening or confirmation of protein interactions and can provide information about the interface where the interaction takes place. Label transfer can also detect weak or transient interactions that are difficult to capture using other ''in vitro'' detection strategies. In a label transfer reaction, a known protein is tagged with a detectable label. The label is then passed to an interacting protein, which can then be identified by the presence of the label.\r\n- **[Y2H - Yeast Two-Hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yeast_two-hybrid)**: Y2H screen investigates the interaction between artificial fusion proteins inside the nucleus of yeast. This approach can identify binding partners of a protein in an unbiased manner.\r\n- **[Phage display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_display)**: used for the high-throughput screening of protein interactions\r\n- **[TAP - Tandem Affinity Purification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_affinity_purification)**: (TAP) method allows high throughput identification of protein interactions. In contrast to yeast two-hybrid approach the accuracy of the method can be compared to those of small-scale experiments and the interactions are detected within the correct cellular environment as by [co-immunoprecipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/co-immunoprecipitation). However, the TAP tag method requires two successive steps of protein purification and consequently it can not readily detect transient protein–protein interactions. \r\n- **[Cross-link/Chemical cross-linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cross-link|Chemical_cross-linking)**: is often used to \"fix\" protein interactions in place before trying to isolate/identify interacting proteins. Common crosslinkers for this application include the non-cleavable [NHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Hydroxysuccinimide)-ester cross-linker, [bissulfosuccinimidyl suberate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bissulfosuccinimidyl_suberate) (BS3); a cleavable version of BS3, [dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl_propionate)) (DTSSP); and the [imidoester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imidoester) cross-linker [dimethyl dithiobispropionimidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dimethyl_dithiobispropionimidate) (DTBP) that is popular for fixing interactions in [ChIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChIP) assays.\r\n- **[SPINE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPINE_(molecular_biology))**: (Strepprotein interaction experiment) uses a combination of reversible crosslinking with formaldehyde and an incorporation of an affinity tag to detect interaction partners ''in vivo''.\r\n- **[Quantitative immunoprecipitation combined with knock-down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_immunoprecipitation_combined_with_knock-down)**: (QUICK) relies on co-immunoprecipitation, quantitative [mass spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_spectrometry) ([SILAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SILAC)) and [RNA interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference) (RNAi). This method detects interactions among endogenous non-tagged proteins. Thus, it has the same high confidence as co-immunoprecipitation. However, this method also depends on the availability of suitable antibodies.\r\n- **[Proximity ligation assay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximity_ligation_assay)**: (PLA) in situ is an immunohistochemical method utilizing so called PLA probes for detection of proteins, protein interactions and modifications.\r\n\r\n### Other Databases\r\n- **[ASD](http://mdl.shsmu.edu.cn/ASD)**: Allosteric Database.\r\n- **[CORNET](https://cornet.psb.ugent.be)**: CORrelation NETworks.\r\n- **[GeneMANIA](http://www.genemania.org)**: GeneMANIA finds other genes that are related to a set of input genes, using a very large set of functional association data.\r\n\r\n## Biological Processes\r\n### Pathways\r\n#### Related Terms\r\n- **Pathway (Biological pathway)**: A biological pathway is a series of actions among molecules in a cell that leads to a certain product or a change in a cell.
