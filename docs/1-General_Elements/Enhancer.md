## Related Terms
- **Enhancer**: In genetics, an enhancer is a short (50-1500 bp) region of DNA that can be bound by proteins (activators) to increase the likelihood that transcription of a particular gene will occur. These proteins are usually referred to as transcription factors. [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhancer_(genetics))
- **Super Enhancer**: In genetics, a super-enhancer is a region of the mammalian genome comprising multiple enhancers that is collectively bound by an array of transcription factor proteins to drive transcription of genes involved in cell identity.
