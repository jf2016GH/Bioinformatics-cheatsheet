- **Protein**: Proteins are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein)
- **Translation**: In molecular biology and genetics, translation is the process in which cellular ribosomes create proteins. In translation, messenger RNA (mRNA)—produced by transcription from DNA—is decoded by a ribosome to produce a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide.
