## Related Terms
- **GWAS**: In genetics, a genome-wide association study (GWA study, or GWAS), also known as whole genome association study (WGA study, or WGAS), is an examination of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in different individuals to see if any variant is associated with a trait.

- **Meta-analysis**: Meta-analysis is routinely used for pooling the results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). [@Review](http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v14/n6/full/nrg3472.html)
- **TWAS**: transcriptome-wide association study through expression imputation. [@Ref](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3506.html)

- **[PrediXcan](https://github.com/hakyim/PrediXcan)**: PrediXcan is a gene-based association test that prioritizes genes that are likely to be causal for the phenotype. [@Ref](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v47/n9/full/ng.3367.html)
- **[MetaXcan](https://github.com/hakyimlab/MetaXcan)**: MetaXcan is an extension of PrediXcan method, that infers the results of PrediXcan using only summary statistics. 
- **[PredictDB](http://predictdb.hakyimlab.org/)**: This PredictDB Data Repository hosts genetic prediction models of transcriptome levels to be used with PrediXcan and MetaXcan.
