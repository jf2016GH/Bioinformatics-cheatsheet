- **T Test**: A t-test is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic follows a Student's t-distribution under the null hypothesis. It can be used to determine if two sets of data are significantly different from each other. [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test)
- **Chi-Squared Test**: also referred to as a {\displaystyle \chi ^{2}} \chi ^{2} test, is any statistical hypothesis test wherein the sampling distribution of the test statistic is a chi-square distribution when the null hypothesis is true. [@Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test)
